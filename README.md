# Type Guards and how they can improve your code quality

Workshop for [TypeScript Berlin Meetup #9](https://www.meetup.com/typescript-berlin/events/287592005/).

**About the topic:**

> TypeScript's biggest advantage is the syntax for typed code. By following strict typing TypeScript's compiler can warn of errors before they occur at runtime. However, it can sometimes be difficult for the compiler to infer the exact type when writing general-purpose functions. In these cases, type guards can help, and we will learn how to program them.

**About the author:**
